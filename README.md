This project contains 2 ipynb files. 

draw_detected_lanes.ipynb : 
  This code will use a M-CNN to edtect lanes. The full code can be found here: https://github.com/mvirgo/MLND-Capstone/tree/master
  Pls recall that there are some decom packages in the parent project causing the detection to suffer...
  To use the pretrained model, pls download the model from here... : https://github.com/mvirgo/MLND-Capstone/blob/master/full_CNN_model.h5
  The information on how the model was trained can be found here: https://github.com/mvirgo/MLND-Capstone/tree/master#readme
  

  Rahul_Das_Final_Project_Lane_Detection:
    This file is using OPENCV for lane detection.
